# Credit-Default-Prediction
Goal of the study is to create a model that predicts if a client will default on credit card payment in next month.
This is a Supervised binary classification problem. Where Defaulter Yes(1) or No(0) is the dependant variable
To find the predictability of a defaulter our main objective is to find what features can play a role to predict a credit card defaulter? Therefore we need to find answers to some questions like:

1. Is the % of defaulters significantly different between male & female ?
2. How does Marital Status effect the proportion of defaulters ?
3. Does the Level of Education play a role in the % of defaulters ?
4. Which age group constitutes for higher proportion of defaulters ?
5. Is the number of defaulters correlated with credit limit ?
6. Is there a pattern in past repayment statuses which can help predict probability of a defaulter ?
7. Does the history of credit card bill amount has a correlation with the % of defaulters ?
